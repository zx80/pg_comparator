=head1 NAME

B<pg_comparator> - efficient table content comparison and synchronization

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pg_comparator> [options as B<--help> B<--option> B<--man>] conn1 conn2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script performs a network and time efficient comparison or
synchronization of two possibly large tables in B<PostgreSQL>, B<MySQL>
or B<SQLite> databases, so as to detect inserted, updated or deleted tuples
between these tables.
The algorithm is efficient especially if the expected differences are
relatively small.

The implementation is quite generic: multi-column keys
(but there must be a key!), no assumption
of data types other that they can be cast to text, subset of columns
can be used for the comparison, handling of NULL values...

This script focuses on the comparison algorithm, hence the many options.
The fact that it may do anything useful, such as checking that a replication
tool does indeed replicates your data, or such as synchronizing tables,
is a mere side effect.

=head1 OPTIONS

Options allow to request help or to adjust some internal parameters.
Short one-letter options are also available, usually with the first letter
of the option name.

=over 4

=item C<--aggregate=(sum|xor)> or C<-a (sum|xor)>

Aggregation function to be used for summaries, either B<xor> or B<sum>.
It must operate on the result of the checksum function.
For PostgreSQL and SQLite, the B<xor> aggregate needs to be loaded.
There is a signed/unsigned issue on the key hash when using B<xor> for
comparing tables on MySQL or SQLite vs PostgreSQL.
We provide a new C<ISUM> aggregate for SQLite because both C<SUM> and C<TOTAL>
do some incompatible handling of integer overflows.

Default is B<sum> because it is available by default and works in mixed mode.

=item C<--ask-pass>

Ask for passwords interactively. See also C<--env-pass> option below.

Default is not to ask for passwords.

=item C<--asynchronous> or C<-A>, C<--no-asynchronous> or C<-X>

Whether to run asynchronous queries. This provides some parallelism, however
the two connections are more or less synchronized per query.

Default is to use asynchronous queries to enable some parallelism.

=item C<--checksum-computation=(create|insert)> or C<--cc=...>

How to create the checksum table.
Use B<create> to use a C<CREATE ... AS SELECT ...> query,
or B<insert> to use a C<CREATE ...; INSERT ... SELECT ...> query.
The former will require an additional counting to get the table size,
so in the end there are two queries anyway.
There is a type size issue with the B<insert> strategy on MySQL, the
cumulated key string length must be under 64 bytes.

Default is B<create> because it always works for both databases.

=item C<--checksum-function=fun> or C<--cf=fun> or C<-c fun>

Checksum function to use, either B<ck>, B<fnv> or B<md5>.
For PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite the provided B<ck> and B<fnv> checksum
functions must be loaded into the target databases.
Choosing B<md5> does not come free either: the provided cast functions must be
loaded into the target databases and the computation is more expensive.

Default is B<ck>, which is fast, especially if the operation is cpu-bound
and the bandwidth is reasonably high.

=item C<--checksum-size=n> or C<--check-size=n> or C<--cs=n> or C<-z n>

Tuple checksum size, must be B<2>, B<4> or B<8> bytes.
The key checksum size is always 4 bytes long.

Default is B<8>, so that the false negative probability is very low.
There should be no reason to change that.

=item C<--cleanup>

Drop checksum and summary tables beforehand.
Useful after a run with C<--no-temp> and C<--no-clear>, typically used
for debugging.

Default is not to drop because it is not needed.

=item C<--clear>

Drop checksum and summary tables explicitly after the computation.
Note that they are dropped implicitly by default when the connection
is closed as they are temporary, see C<-(-no)-temporary> option.
This option is useful for debugging.

Default is B<not> to clear explicitly the checksum and summary tables,
as it is not needed.

=item C<--debug> or C<-d>

Set debug mode. Repeat for higher debug levels. See also C<--verbose>.
Beware that some safe gards about option settings are skipped under
debug so as to allow testing under different conditions.

Default is not to run in debug mode.

=item C<--env-pass='var'>

Take password from environment variables C<var1>, C<var2> or C<var>
for connection one, two, or both.
This is tried before asking interactively if C<--ask-pass> is also set.

Default is not to look for passwords from environment variables.

=item C<--expect n> or C<-e n>

Total number of differences to expect (updates, deletes and inserts).
This option is only used for non regression tests. See the TESTS section.

=item C<--folding-factor=7> or C<-f 7>

Folding factor: log2 of the number of rows grouped together at each stage,
starting from the leaves so that the first round always groups as many records
as possible. The power of two allows one to use masked computations.
The minimum value of 1 builds a binary tree.

Default folding factor log2 is B<7>, i.e. size 128 folds.
This default value was chosen after some basic tests on medium-size cases
with medium or low bandwidth. Values from 4 to 8 should be a reasonable
choice for most settings.

=item C<--help> or C<-h>

Show short help.

=item C<--key-checksum='kcs'> or C<--kcs=...>

Use key checksum attribute of this name, which must be already available in
the tables to compare. This option also requires option C<--tuple-checksum>.
See also the EXAMPLES section below for how to set a checksum trigger.
Consider C<--use-key> instead if you already have a reasonably distributed
integer primary key.

Default is to build both key and tuple checksums on the fly.

=item C<--lock>, C<--no-lock>

Whether to lock tables.
Setting the option explicitly overrides the default one way or another.
For PostgreSQL, this option requires C<--transaction>, which is enabled by
default.

Default depends on the current operation: the table is I<not locked> for a
comparison, but it is I<locked> for a synchronization.

=item C<--long-read-len=0> or C<-L 0>

Set max size for fetched binary large objects.
Well, it seems to be ignored at least by the PostgreSQL driver.

Default is to keep the default value set by the driver.

=item C<--man> or C<-m>

Show manual page interactively in the terminal.

=item C<--max-ratio=0.1>

Maximum relative search effort. The search is stopped if the number of results
is above this threshold expressed relatively to the table size.
Use 2.0 for no limit (all tuples were deleted and new ones are inserted).

Default is B<0.1>, i.e. an overall 10% difference is allowed before giving up.

=item C<--max-report=n>

Maximum absolute search effort. The search is stopped if the number of
differences goes beyond this threshold. If set, the previous C<--max-ratio>
option is ignored, otherwise the effort is computed with the ratio once
the table size is known.

Default is to compute the maximum number of reported differences based on
the C<--max-ratio> option, with a minimum of 100 differences allowed.

=item C<--max-levels=0>

Maximum number of levels used. Allows one to cut-off folding. 0 means no cut-off.
Setting a value of 1 would only use the checksum table, without summaries.
A value of 3 or 4 would be raisonable, as the last levels of the tree are
nice for the theoretical complexity formula, but do not improve performance
in practice.

Default is B<0>.

=item C<--null='text'>

How to handle NULL values. Either B<hash> to hash all values, where NULL
has one special hash value, or B<text> where NULL values are substituted
by the C<NULL> string.

Default is B<text> because it is faster.

=item C<--option> or C<-o>

Show option summary.

=item C<--pg-text-cast>

With PostgreSQL add explicit TEXT casts to work around some typing issues.

=item C<--pg-copy=128>

Experimental option to use PostgreSQL's COPY instead of INSERT/UPDATE
when synchronizing, by chunks of the specified size.

=item C<--prefix='pgc_cmp'>

Name prefix, possibly schema qualified, used for generated comparison tables
by appending numbers to it. Consider changing the prefix if you expect several
comparisons to run concurrently against the same database.

Default is C<pgc_cmp>. Cheksum tables is named C<pgc_cmp_1_0> and
C<pgc_cmp_2_0>, and summary tables are named by increasing the last number.

=item C<--report>, C<--no-report>

Report differing keys to stdout as they are found.

Default is to report.

=item C<--separator='|'> or C<-s '|'>

Separator string or character used when concatenating key columns for
computing checksums.

Defaults to the pipe '|' character.

=item C<--size=n>

Assume this value as the table size. It is sufficient for the algorithm to
perform well that this size is in the order of magnitude of the actual table
size.

Default is to query the table sizes, which is skipped if this option is set.

=item C<--source-1='DBI:...'>, C<--source-2='...'> or C<-1 '...'>, C<-2 '...'>

Take full control of DBI data source specification and mostly ignore
the comparison authentication part of the source or target URLs.
One can connect with "DBI:Pg:service=backup", use an alternate driver,
set any option allowed by the driver...
See C<DBD::Pg> and C<DBD:mysql> manuals for the various options that can
be set through the DBI data source specification.
However, the database server specified in the URL must be consistent with
this source specification so that the queries' syntax is the right one.

Default is to rely on the two URL arguments.

=item C<--skip-inserts>, C<--skip-updates>, C<--skip-deletes>

When synchronizing, do not perform these operations.

Default under C<--synchronize> is to do all operations.

=item C<--stats=(txt|csv)>

Show various statistics about the comparison performed in this format.
Also, option C<--stats-name> gives the test a name, useful to generate csv
files that will be processed automatically.

Default is B<not> to show statistics, because it requires additional
synchronizations and is not necessarily interesting to the user.

=item C<--synchronize> or C<-S>

Actually perform operations to synchronize the second table wrt the first.
Well, not really, it is only a dry run. It is actually done if you add
C<--do-it> or C<-D>. Save your data before attempting anything like that!

Default is not to synchronize.

=item C<--temporary>, C<--no-temporary>

Whether to use temporary tables. If you don't, the tables are kept by default
at the end, so they will have to be deleted by hand. See C<--clear> option
to request a cleanup. This option is useful for debugging.

Default is to use temporary tables that are automatically wiped out when the
connection is closed.

=item C<--unlogged>, C<--no-unlogged>

Use unlogged tables for storing checksums. These tables are not transactional,
so it may speed up things a little. However, they are not automatically cleaned
up at the end. See C<--clear> option to request a cleanup.

Default is not to use unlogged tables.

=item C<--threads> or C<-T>, C<--no-threads> or C<-N>

Highly EXPERIMENTAL feature.

Try to use threads to perform computations in parallel, with some hocus-pocus
because perl thread model does not really work well with DBI.
Perl threads are rather heavy and slow, more like communicating processes than
light weight threads, really.

This does NOT work at all with PostgreSQL.
It works partially with MySQL, at the price of turning off C<--transaction>.

Default is B<not> to use threads, as it does not work for all databases.

=item C<--timeout n>

Timeout comparison after C<n> seconds.

Default is no timeout. Be patient.

=item C<--transaction>, C<--no-transaction>

Whether to wrap the whole algorithm in a single transaction.

Default is to use a wrapping transaction, as it seems to be both faster and
safer to do so.

=item C<--tuple-checksum='tcs'> or C<--tcs=...>

Use tuple checksum attribute of this name, which must be already available
in the tables to compare. This option requires to set also either C<--use-key>
or C<--key-checksum=...> above. The provided checksum attributes must
not appear in the lists of key and value columns.
See also the EXAMPLES section below for how to set a checksum trigger.

Default is to build both key and tuple checksums on the fly.

=item C<--use-key> or C<-u>

Whether to directly use the value of the key to distribute tuples among
branches. The key must be simple, integer, not NULL, and evenly distributed.
If you have a reasonably spread integer primary key, consider using this option
to avoid half of the checksum table hash computations.

Default is to hash the key, so as to handle any type, composition and
distribution.

=item C<--use-null>, C<--no-use-null>

Whether to use the information that a column is declared NOT NULL to
simplify computations by avoiding calls to COALESCE to handle NULL values.

Default is to use this information, at the price of querying table metadata.

=item C<--verbose> or C<-v>

Be verbose about what is happening. The more you ask, the more verbose.

Default is to be quiet, so that possible warnings or errors stand out.

=item C<--version> or C<-V>

Show version information and exit.

=item C<--where=...>

SQL boolean condition on table tuples for partial comparison.
Useful to reduce the load if you know that expected differences are in
some parts of your data, say those time-stamped today...
The same condition is passed on both sides, so both tables must be pretty
similar so that it works. This is usually the case.

Default is to compare whole tables.

=back

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The two arguments describe database connections with the following URL-like
syntax, where square brackets denote optional parts. Many parts are optional
with a default. The minimum syntactically correct specification is C</>, but
that does not necessary mean anything useful.

  [driver://][login[:pass]@][host][:port]/[base/[[schema.]table[?key[:cols]]]]

See the EXAMPLES section below, and also the C<--source-*> options above.

Note that some default value used by DBI drivers may be changed with
driver-specific environment variables, and that DBI also provides its own
defaults and overrides, so what actually happens may not always be clear.
Default values for the second URL are mostly taken from the first URL.

=over 4

=item B<driver>

Database driver to use.
Use B<pgsql> for PostgreSQL, B<mysql> for MySQL, B<sqlite> for SQLite.
Heterogeneous databases may be compared and synchronized, however beware that
subtle typing, encoding and casting issues may prevent heterogeneous
comparisons or synchronizations to succeed.
Default is B<pgsql> for the first connection, and same as first for second.

For SQLite, the authentication part of the URL (login, pass, host, port)
is expected to be empty, thus the full URL should look like:

  sqlite:///base.db/table?key,col:other,columns

Moreover, setting the PGC_SQLITE_LOAD_EXTENSION environment variable with
C<:>-separated shared object files loads these into SQLite.

=item B<login>

Login to use when connecting to database. Default is username for first
connection, and same as first connection for second.

=item B<pass>

Password to use when connecting to database.
Note that it is a bad idea to put a password as a command argument.
Default is none for the first connection, and the same password
as the first connection for the second I<if> the connection targets
the same host, port and uses the same login.
See also C<--ask-pass> and C<--env-pass> options.

=item B<host>

Hostname or IP to connect to.
Default is the empty string, which means connecting to the database on
localhost with a UNIX socket.

=item B<port>

TCP-IP port to connect to.
Default is 5432 for PostgreSQL and 3306 for MySQL.

=item B<base>

Database catalog to connect to. Default is username for first connection.
Default is same as first connection for second connection.
For SQLite, provide the database file name. The path is relative by
default, but can be made absolute by prepending an additional '/':

  sqlite:////var/cache/sqlite/base.db/table?...

=item B<schema.table>

The possibly schema-qualified table to use for comparison.
No default for first connection.
Default is same as first connection for second connection.

Note that MySQL does not have I<schemas>, so the schema part must be empty.
However, strangely enough, their I<database> concept is just like a
I<schema>, so one could say that MySQL really does not have I<databases>,
although there is something of that name. Am I clear?

=item B<keys>

Comma-separated list of key columns.
Default is table primary key for first connection.
Default is same as first connection for second connection.
The key B<cannot> be empty. If you do not have a way of identifying
your tuples, then there is no point in looking for differences.

=item B<cols>

Comma-separated list of columns to compare. May be empty.
Default is all columns but B<keys> for first connection.
Default is same as first connection for second connection.
Beware that C<...?key:> means an empty cols, while C<...?key>
sets the default by querying table metadata.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

Compare tables calvin and hobbes in database family on localhost,
with key I<id> and columns I<c1> and I<c2>:

  ./pg_comparator /family/calvin?id:c1,c2 /family/hobbes

Compare tables calvin in default database on localhost and the same
table in default database on sablons, with key I<id> and column I<data>:

  ./pg_comparator localhost/family/calvin?id:data sablons/

Synchronize C<user> table in database C<wikipedia> from MySQL on
C<server1> to PostgreSQL on C<server2>.

  ./pg_comparator -S -D --ask-pass \
      mysql://calvin@server1/wikipedia/user pgsql://hobbes@server2/

For PostgreSQL, you may add trigger-maintained key and tuple checksums as:

  -- TABLE Foo(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, data ... NOT NULL);
  -- add a key and tuple checksum attributes
  -- the key checksum can be skipped if you use --use-key,
  -- for which the key must be a simple NOT NULL integer.
  ALTER TABLE Foo
    ADD COLUMN key_cs INT4 NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    ADD COLUMN tup_cs INT8 NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
  -- function to update the tuple checksum
  -- if some attributes may be NULL, they must be coalesced
  CREATE FUNCTION foo_cs() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
    BEGIN
      -- compute key checksum
      NEW.key_cs = cksum4(NEW.id);
      -- compute tuple checksum
      NEW.tup_cs = cksum8(NEW.id || '|' || NEW.data);
      RETURN NEW;
    END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
  -- set trigger to call the checksum update function
  CREATE TRIGGER foo_cs_trigger
    BEFORE UPDATE OR INSERT ON Foo
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE foo_cs();
  -- if table Foo is not initially empty,
  -- update its contents to trigger checksum computations
  UPDATE Foo SET id=id;

Then a fast comparison, which does not need to compute the initial checksum
table, can be requested with:

  ./pg_comparator --tcs=tup_cs --kcs=key_cs \
      admin@server1/app/Foo?id:data hobbes@server2/

As the primary key is a simple integer, the I<key_cs> could be left out
and the comparison could be launched with:

  ./pg_comparator --tcs=tup_cs --use-key \
      admin@server1/app/Foo?id:data hobbes@server2/

=head1 OUTPUT

The output of the command consists of lines describing the differences
found between the two tables. They are expressed in term of insertions,
updates or deletes and of tuple keys.

=over 4

=item B<UPDATE k>

Key I<k> tuple is updated from table 1 to table 2.
It exists in both tables with different values.

=item B<INSERT k>

Key I<k> tuple does not appear in table 2, but only in table 1.
It must be inserted in table 2 to synchronize it wrt table 1.

=item B<DELETE k>

Key I<k> tuple appears in table 2, but not in table 1.
It must be deleted from 2 to synchronize it wrt table 1.

=back

In case of tuple checksum collisions, false negative results may occur.
Changing the checksum function would help in such cases.
See the ANALYSIS sub-section.

=head1 INSTALL

This section describes how to install extensions (functions, casts, aggregates)
needed by pg_comparator for the different target databases.

First, get pg_comparator
L<sources|http://www.coelho.net/pg_comparator/pg_comparator-@VERSION@.tgz>.

=head2 PostgreSQL

For installing on PostgreSQL, you must ensure that the C<pg_config> command
found in your path is the one of the target PostgreSQL server, and that
development packages are installed.

Then compile and install the extensions' shared objects:

  sh> make pgsql_install

To load the extension files into the target C<DB> database,
where C<...> are the connection options:

  sh> psql ... -c 'CREATE EXTENSION pgcmp' DB

To uninstall:

  sh> psql ... -c 'DROP EXTENSION pgcmp' DB
  sh> make pgsql_uninstall

=head2 MySQL

For installing on MySQL, you must ensure that the C<mysql_config> command
found in your path is the one of the target MySQL server, and that
development packages are installed.

Then compile and install the extensions' shared objects:

  sh> make mysql_install

And load the extension files into the database:

  sh> mysql ... < PATH-TO-EXTENSION/mysql_casts.sql
  sh> mysql ... < PATH-TO-EXTENSION/mysql_checksum.sql

See C<mysql_config --plugindir> for the extension directory path.
On some systems C<PATH-TO-EXTENSION> might be C</usr/lib/mysql/contrib>.

To uninstall:

  sh> make mysql_uninstall

=head2 SQLite

For installing with SQLite, the corresponding development package is needed.

First compile and install the extensions' shared objects (you
may adjust C<SQLITE.libdir> make variable to change the target directory,
which is by default C</usr/local/lib>):

  sh> make sqlite_install

Then load the extension by executing (to do it always, you may
append the line to your C<.sqliterc> file):

  SELECT load_extension('/usr/local/lib/sqlite_checksum.so');

To uninstall:

  sh> make sqlite_uninstall

=head1 DEPENDENCES

Three support functions are needed on the database:

=over 2

=item 1

The C<COALESCE> function takes care of NULL values in columns.

=item 2

A checksum function must be used to reduce and distribute key
and columns values. It may be changed with the C<--checksum> option.
Its size can be selected with the C<--checksize> option (currently 2, 4 or 8
bytes). The checksums also require casts to be converted to integers of
various sizes.

Suitable implementations are available for PostgreSQL and can be loaded into
the server by processing C<share/contrib/pgc_checksum.sql> and
C<share/contrib/pgc_casts.sql>. New checksums and casts are also available
for MySQL, see C<mysql_*.sql>. An loadable implementation of suitable
checksum functions is also available for SQLite, see C<sqlite_checksum.*>.

The C<ck> checksum is based on
L<Jenkins hash|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_hash>,
which relies on simple add, shift and xor integer operations.
The C<fnv> checksum is inspired by
L<FNV hash|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler_Noll_Vo_hash>
(64 bits 1a version) which uses xor and mult integer operations,
although I also added some shift and add to help tweak high bits.

=item 3

An aggregate function is used to summarize checksums for a range of rows.
It must operate on the result of the checksum function.
It may be changed with the C<--aggregate> option.

Suitable implementations of a exclusive-or C<xor> aggregate are available
for PostgreSQL and can be loaded into the server by processing
C<share/contrib/xor_aggregate.sql>.

The C<sqlite_checksum.*> file also provides a C<xor> and C<sum> aggregates
for SQLite that are compatible with other databases.

=back

Moreover several perl modules are useful to run this script:

=over 4

=item

C<Getopt::Long> for option management.

=item

C<DBI>,
C<DBD::Pg> to connect to PostgreSQL,
C<DBD::mysql> to connect to MySQL,
and C<DBD::SQLite> to connect to SQLite.

=item

C<Term::ReadPassword> for C<--ask-pass> option.

=item

C<Pod::Usage> for doc self-extraction (C<--man> C<--opt> C<--help>).

=item

C<threads> for the experimental threaded version with option C<--threads>.

=item

C<Digest::MD5> for md5 checksum with SQLite.

=back

Modules are only loaded by the script if they are actually required.

=head1 ALGORITHM

The aim of the algorithm is to compare the content of two tables,
possibly on different remote servers, with minimum network traffic.
It is performed in three phases.

=over 2

=item 1

A checksum table is computed on each side for the target table.

=item 2

A fist level summary table is computed on each side by aggregating chunks
of the checksum table. Other levels of summary aggregations are then performed
till there is only one row in the last table, which then stores a
global checksum for the whole initial target tables.

=item 3

Starting from the upper summary tables, aggregated checksums are compared
from both sides to look for differences, down to the initial checksum table.
Keys of differing tuples are displayed.

=back

=head2 CHECKSUM TABLE

The first phase computes the initial checksum table I<T(0)> on each side.
Assuming that I<key> is the table key columns, and I<cols> is the
table data columns that are to be checked for differences, then
it is performed by querying target table I<T> as follow:

  CREATE TABLE T(0) AS
    SELECT key AS pk,                   -- primary key
           checksum(key) AS kcs,        -- key checksum
           checksum(key || cols) AS tcs -- tuple checksum
    FROM t;

The initial key is kept, as it will be used to show differing keys
at the end. The rational for the I<kcs> column is to randomize the
key-values distribution so as to balance aggregates in the next phase.
The key must appear in the checksum also, otherwise content exchanged
between two keys would not be detected in some cases.

=head2 SUMMARY TABLES

Now we compute a set of cascading summary tables by grouping I<f>
(folding factor) checksums together at each stage. The grouping is
based on a mask on the I<kcs> column to take advantage of the
checksum randomization. Starting from I<p=0> we build:

  CREATE TABLE T(p+1) AS
    SELECT kcs & mask(p+1) AS kcs, -- key checksum subset
           XOR(tcs) AS tcs         -- tuple checksum summary
    FROM T(p)
    GROUP BY kcs & mask(p+1);

The mask(p) is defined so that it groups together on average I<f>
checksums together: mask(0) = ceil2(size); mask(p) = mask(p-1)/f;
This leads to a hierarchy of tables, each one being a smaller summary
of the previous one:

=over 4

=item level B<0>

checksum table, I<size> rows, i.e. as many rows as the target table.

=item level B<1>

first summary table, (size/f) rows.

=item level B<p>

intermediate summary table, (size/f**p) rows.

=item level B<n-1>

one before last summary table, less than f rows.

=item level B<n>

last summary table, mask is 0, 1 row.

=back

It is important that the very same masks are used on both sides so that
aggregations are the same, allowing to compare matching contents on both sides.

=head2 SEARCH FOR DIFFERENCES

After all these support tables are built on both sides comes the search for
differences. When checking the checksum summary of the last tables (level I<n>)
with only one row, it is basically a comparison of the checksum of the
whole table contents. If they match, then both tables are equal,
and we are done. Otherwise, if these checksums differ, some investigation
is needed to detect offending keys.

The investigation is performed by going down the table hierarchy and
looking for all I<kcs> for which there was a difference in the checksum
on the previous level. The same query is performed on both side
at each stage:

  SELECT kcs, tcs
  FROM T(p)
  WHERE kcs & mask(p+1) IN (kcs-with-diff-checksums-from-level-p+1)
  ORDER BY kcs [and on level 0: , id];

And the results from both sides are merged together.
When doing the merge procedure, four cases can arise:

=over 2

=item 1

Both I<kcs> and I<tcs> match. Then there is no difference.

=item 2

Although I<kcs> does match, I<tcs> does not. Then this I<kcs> is
to be investigated at the next level, as the checksum summary differs.
If we are already at the last level, then the offending key can be shown.

=item 3

No I<kcs> match, one supplemental I<kcs> in the first side.
Then this I<kcs> correspond to key(s) that must be inserted
for syncing the second table wrt the first.

=item 4

No I<kcs> match, one supplemental I<kcs> in the second side.
Then this I<kcs> correspond to key(s) that must be deleted
for syncing the second table wrt the first.

=back

Cases 3 and 4 are simply symmetrical, and it is only an interpretation
to decide whether it is an insert or a delete, taking the first side
as the reference.

=head2 ANALYSIS

Let I<n> be the number of rows, I<r> the row size, I<f> the folding factor,
I<k> the number of differences to be detected, I<c> the checksum size in bits,
then the costs to identify differences and the error rate is:

=over 2

=item B<network volume>

is better than I<k*f*ceil(log(n)/log(f))*(c+log(n))>.
the contents of I<k> blocks of size I<f> is transferred on the depth
of the tree, and each block identifier is of size I<log(n)> and contains
a checksum I<c>.
It is independent of I<r>, and you want I<k<<n>.
The volume of the SQL requests is about I<k*log(n)*ceil(log(n)/log(f))>,
as the list of non matching checksums I<k*log(n)> may be dragged
on the tree depth.

=item B<number of requests (on each side, the algorithm is symmetric)>

minimum is I<6+ceil(log(n)/log(f))> for equal tables,
maximum is I<6+2*ceil(log(n)/log(f))>.

=item B<disk I/O traffic>

is about I<n*r+n*ln(n)*(f/(f-1))>.

=item B<false negative probability>

I<i.e.> part of the tables are considered equal although they are different.
With a perfect checksum function, this is the probability of a checksum
collision at any point where they are computed and should have been different:
about I<k*ceil(log(n)/log(f))*2**-c>.
For a million row table, expecting 1000 changes with the default algorithm
parameter values, this is about I<2**10 *3/2**64>, that is about one chance
in I<2**52> merge runs.

=back

The lower the folding factor I<f> the better for the network volume,
but the higher the better for the number of requests and disk I/Os:
the choice of I<f> is a tradeoff.

The lower the checksum size I<c>, the better for the network volume,
but the worse for the false negative probability.

If the available bandwidth is reasonable, the comparison will most likely
be cpu-bound: the time is spent mainly on computing the initial checksum table.
Thus if you are planning to check for differences quite often, consider
maintaining a tuple checksum with a trigger, and possibly a key checksum
as well, and invoke with C<--tuple-checksum> and either C<--key-checksum>
or C<--use-key>.

=head2 IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES

The checksum implementation gives integers, which are constant length
and easy to manipulate afterwards.

The B<xor> aggregate is a good choice because there is no overflow issue with
it, it takes into account all bits of the input, and it can easily be defined
on any binary data. The B<sum> aggregate is also okay, but it requires some
kind of underlying integer type.

NULL values must be taken care appropriately.

The folding factor and all modules are taken as power of two so as to use
a masks.

There is a special management of large chunks of deletes or inserts
which is implemented although not detailed in the algorithmic overview
and complexity analysis.

There is some efforts to build a PostgreSQL/MySQL compatible implementation
of the algorithm, which added hacks to deal with type conversions and other
stuff.

This script is reasonably tested, but due to its proof of concept nature
there is a lot of options the combination of which cannot all be tested.

=head2 NOTE

If the tables to compare are in the same database, a simple SQL
query can extract the differences. Assuming Tables I<T1> and I<T2>
with primary key I<id> and non null contents I<data>, then their
differences, that is how I<T2> differs from the reference I<T1>,
is summarized by the following query:

        SELECT COALESCE(T1.id, T2.id) AS key,
          CASE WHEN T1.id IS NULL THEN 'DELETE'
               WHEN T2.id IS NULL THEN 'INSERT'
               ELSE 'UPDATE'
          END AS operation
        FROM T1 FULL JOIN T2 USING (id)
        WHERE T1.id IS NULL      -- DELETE
           OR T2.id IS NULL      -- INSERT
           OR T1.data <> T2.data -- UPDATE

Advances in Databases, Knowledge, and Data Applications (DBKDA),
pp 23-28, St Marteen, The Netherlands Antilles, January 2011.

Copyright IARIA 2011.
Online at L<Think Mind|http://www.thinkmind.org/index.php?view=article&articleid=dbkda_2011_2_10_30021>.

The algorithm and script was inspired by
B<Taming the Distributed Database Problem: A Case Study Using MySQL>
by I<Giuseppe Maxia> in B<Sys Admin> vol 13 num 8, Aug 2004, pp 29-40.
See L<Perl Monks|http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=381053> for details.
In this paper, three algorithms are presented.
The first one compares two tables with a checksum technique.
The second one finds UPDATE or INSERT differences based on a 2-level
(checksum and summary) table hierarchy. The algorithm is asymmetrical,
as different queries are performed on the two tables to compare.
It seems that the network traffic volume is in I<k*(f+(n/f)+r)>,
that it has a probabilistically-buggy merge procedure, and
that it makes assumptions about the distribution of key values.
The third algorithm looks for DELETE differences based on counting,
with the implicit assumption that there are only such differences.

In contrast to this approach, our fully symmetrical algorithm implements
all three tasks at once, to find UPDATE, DELETE and INSERT between the two
tables. The checksum and summary hierarchical level idea is reused and
generalized so as to reduce the algorithmic complexity.

From the implementation standpoint, the script is as parametric as possible
with many options, and makes few assumptions about table structures, types
and values.

=head1 TESTS

The paper reports numerous performance tests with PostgreSQL under various
bandwidth constraints.

Moreover, non regression tests are run over randomly generated tables
when the software is upgraded:

=over 4

=item I<sanity> - about 30 seconds & 30 runs

Run a comparison, synchronization & check for all databases combinaisons
and all working asynchronous queries and threading options.

=item I<fast> - about 5 minutes & 360 runs

Run 12 tests similar to the previous one with varrying options (number of
key columns, number of value columns, aggregate function, checksum function,
null handling, folding factor, table locking or not...).

=item I<feature> - about 5 minutes & 171 or 477 runs

Test various features:
I<cc> for checksum computation strategies,
I<auto> for trigger-maintained checksums on PostgreSQL,
I<pgcopy> for PostgreSQL copy test,
I<empty> for corner cases with empty tables,
I<quote> for table quoting,
I<engine> for InnoDB vs MyISAM MySQL backends,
I<width> for large columns,
I<nullkey> for possible NULL values in keys,
I<sqlite> for SQLite test,
I<mylite> for SQLite/MySQL mixed mode with some restrictions,
I<pglite> for SQLite/PostgreSQL mixed mode with some restrictions.

=item I<release> - about 20 minutes & 944 runs

This is I<feature> with two table sizes, I<fast>, and I<collisions>
to test possible hash collisions.

=item I<hour> - about 1 hour & 2880 runs

A combination of 8 I<fast> validations with varrying table sizes and
difference ratio ranging from 0.1% to 99.9%.

=item I<full> - about 6 hours & 16128 runs... seldom run

A combinatorial test involving numerous options: aggregation, checksums,
null handling, foldings, number of key and value attributes...

=head1 BUGS

All software have bugs. This is a software, hence it has bugs.

Reporting bugs is good practice, so tell me if you find one.
If you have a fix, this is even better!

The implementation does not do many sanity checks.

Although the algorithm can work with some normalized columns
(say strings are trimmed, lowercased, Unicode normalized...),
the implementation may not work at all.

The script is really tested with integer and text types, issues may arise
with other types.

The script handles one table at a time. In order to synchronize several
linked tables, you must disable referential integrity checks, then
synchronize each tables, then re-enable the checks.

There is no real attempt at doing some sensible identifier quoting,
although quotes provided in the connection url are kept, so it may work
after all for simple enough cases.

There is no neat user interfaces, this is a earthly command line tool.
This is not a bug, but a feature.

There are too many options.

Using another language such as Python for this application seems attractive,
but there is no cleanly integrated manual-page style support such as POD, and
the documentation is 50% of this script.

Mixed SQLite vs PostgreSQL or MySQL table comparison may not work properly in
all cases, because of SQLite dynamic type handling and reduced capabilities.

The script creates (temporary) tables on both sides for comparing the target
tables: this imply that you must be allowed to do that for the comparison...
However, read-only replicas do not allow creating objects, which mean that you
cannot use pg_comparator to compare table contents on a synchronized replica.

=head1 TODO

Allow larger checksum sizes.

Add an option to avoid IN (x,y,...) syntax, maybe with a temporary table
to hold values and use a JOIN on that. I'm not sure about the performance
implications, though.

Allow generating the SQL update script without applying it.

Option to generate more compact updates, i.e. only update attributes with
different values.

=head1 VERSIONS

See L<web site|http://www.coelho.net/pg_comparator/> for the latest version.
Although versions are really managed with SVN, there is also a
L<github repos|https://github.com/zx80/pg_comparator>.

Make the mask computation match its above documentation with a bottom-up
derivation, instead of a simpler top-down formula which results in bad
performances when a power of the factor is close to the size (as pointed
out in I<Benjamin Mead Vandiver>'s PhD).
This bad mask computation was introduced somehow between 1.3 and 1.4 as
an attempt at simplifying the code.

  # Firebird: this is a strange bird...
  #
  # - it is based on windows-oriented open-sourced Borland's InterBase.
  # - it mixes both client-server features (host, port, user, pass) and
  #   sqlite-like single-file storage for which you must know the path.
  #   this seems pretty inconsistent.
  # - <sigh>passwords are stored in plaintext</sigh>.
  # - the documentation is only "differential" from one version to the next,
  #   or one database to the other: I have found no consolidated reference.
  # - the DBD driver seems buggy (see close_cursor workaround) and is missing
  #   column_info and other metadata features that I need.
  # - the "isql" command cannot connect from the shell, one must issue a
  #   "CONNECT 'path';" interactively, this makes testing harder.
  # - some features are implemented strangely: e.g. temporary tables are "global
  #   temporary" and are not dropped, only their contents is deleted on exit.
  # - there is no "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ...", thus manual cleaning on errors.
  # - there is no "CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT ..."
  # - typename 'BLOB SUB_TYPE TEXT'... the standard TEXT would have been nicer.
  # - SUM() and CAST( ...) detect overflows where I wish they would not.
  # - I found no simple way to add a new aggregate function.
  # - the project seems on a slow development space.
  # - the comparisons seem very slow.
